1st, installed the dependencies 

expo install @react-navigation/native
expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
expo install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs

rather than using the arguments in the funcitions, the modern way is to use the hooks and state methodology where we can pass the state anywhaere we wwant to change it!
